# Gemini API-Integrated Chatbot Using Streamlit
In this project, I developed a chatbot using the Gemini API and deployed it on a web application built with Streamlit. The chatbot interacts with users to provide real-time information or perform actions based on requests, leveraging the capabilities of the Gemini API.

Key features of the project include:

Integration with the Gemini API to fetch relevant data (e.g., financial data, cryptocurrency prices, or any data exposed by Gemini).
Building the chatbot interface using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the chatbot in a user-friendly web environment.
Handling user input and API requests in real-time, with the chatbot responding instantly based on the data retrieved from Gemini.
Implementing natural language processing (NLP) techniques to enhance the chatbot's ability to understand and respond to user queries.
Deployed as a web application, accessible via a web browser, making the chatbot easy to use without the need for additional software installation.
This project showcases the integration of a third-party API with a conversational chatbot, packaged in an interactive and easy-to-use web app.
